# Google's Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (CCAI)

### A software-based customer service system that understands and interacts with callers. It is designed for technical learners who want to design customer conversations using CCAI and its integrations with Google Cloud products.

The goal and benefits of CCAI
Lowers costs and increases customer satisfaction
Provides an opportunity to redesign customer experience

The target audience and prerequisites of this course
Technical learners with little to no AI experience
Conversational designers, developers, and operations specialists

The content and structure of this course
Covers the use of Dialogflow and natural-language understanding
Identifies best practices for virtual agent design
Shows how to collaborate with a virtual agent developer


A solution that uses AI to improve customer service and reduce costs. It compares CCAI with traditional interactive voice response (IVR) systems and shows how CCAI can provide natural and powerful self-service options and real-time guidance for human agents.

The drawbacks of traditional IVRs
Expensive and complex to host or pay for
Require IVR experts to develop and manage
Fail to serve the end customer’s needs
The challenges of a typical contact center
High costs of hiring, training, and managing agents
Tradeoffs between agent availability and customer satisfaction
Repetitive, low-value problems that waste agent’s time
The customer’s perspective and frustrations
Long queue-wait or agent hold times
Multiple transfers and authentication questions
Difficult to navigate IVR system
Lack of information and options
The benefits of CCAI for customers and businesses
Immediate 24/7 self-service in a conversational way
Seamless transition to a human agent with AI assistance
Better analytics to measure success
Solve more calls without a human agent
Enable live agents to be more efficient and helpful
Resolve issues faster and increase revenue and loyalty
Lower agent recruiting, onboarding, and infrastructure costs



This video introduces Dialogflow, a natural language understanding platform that can create conversational user interfaces for various applications and devices. It also explains how Dialogflow fits within the CCI architecture and how it differs from traditional IVR systems.
Highlights:
[00:00:00]3 What is Dialogflow
A platform to design and integrate conversational interfaces
A build once, deploy everywhere development suite
A product for creating virtual contact center agents
[00:00:59]4 What is the conversational core
The brain of the CCI architecture
Handles speech-to-text, natural language processing, and text-to-speech
Not the same as the Dialogflow back end
[00:01:53]5 How does a customer call flow through the CCI architecture
Starts with a telephony system or a Google partner CTI
Creates a session and converts speech to text
Uses Dialogflow to interpret and structure responses
Uses text-to-speech to generate voice
Hands off to a human agent if needed
[00:03:14]6 What are the other components of the CCI architecture
Agent Assist to monitor and assist human agents
Knowledge service to access back end databases
Insights to provide metrics and analysis
[00:03:33]7 What Dialogflow is not
Not suitable for creating typical IVR decision trees
Allows natural and rich interactions without menus
Learns and tweaks algorithms as more users engage
