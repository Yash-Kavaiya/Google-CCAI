# Google's Contact Center Artificial Intelligence (CCAI)
- A software-based customer service system that understands and interacts with callers. It is designed for technical learners who want to design customer conversations using CCAI and its integrations with Google Cloud products.

## The goal and benefits of CCAI
- Lowers costs and increases customer satisfaction
- Provides an opportunity to redesign customer experience

## The target audience and prerequisites of this course
- Technical learners with little to no AI experience
- Conversational designers, developers, and operations specialists

## The content and structure of this course
 - Covers the use of Dialogflow and natural-language understanding
- Identifies best practices for virtual agent design
- Shows how to collaborate with a virtual agent developer
# What is Contact Center AI?
 - A solution that uses AI to improve customer service and reduce costs. It compares CCAI with traditional interactive voice response (IVR) systems and shows how CCAI can provide natural and powerful self-service options and real-time guidance for human agents.

## The goal and benefits of CCAI
- Lowers costs and increases customer satisfaction
- Provides an opportunity to redesign customer experience

## The target audience and prerequisites of this course

- Conversational designers, developers, and operations specialists

## The content and structure of this course
- Covers the use of Dialogflow and natural-language understanding
- Identifies best practices for virtual agent design
- Shows how to collaborate with a virtual agent developer

## The drawbacks of traditional IVRs
- Expensive and complex to host or pay for
- Require IVR experts to develop and manage
- Fail to serve the end customer’s needs
- The challenges of a typical contact center
- High costs of hiring, training, and managing agents
- Tradeoffs between agent availability and customer satisfaction
- Repetitive, low-value problems that waste agent’s time
- The customer’s perspective and frustrations
- Long queue-wait or agent hold times
- Multiple transfers and authentication questions
- Difficult to navigate IVR system
- Lack of information and options
  
## The benefits of CCAI for customers and businesses
- Immediate 24/7 self-service in a conversational way
- Seamless transition to a human agent with AI assistance
- Better analytics to measure success
- Solve more calls without a human agent
- Enable live agents to be more efficient and helpful
- Resolve issues faster and increase revenue and loyalty
- Lower agent recruiting, onboarding, and infrastructure costs

## Dialogflow  
Dialogflow, a natural language understanding platform that can create conversational user interfaces for various applications and devices. It also explains how Dialogflow fits within the CCI architecture and how it differs from traditional IVR systems.

### What is Dialogflow
- A platform to design and integrate conversational interfaces
- A build once, deploy everywhere development suite
- A product for creating virtual contact center agents
- The brain of the CCAI architecture
- Handles speech-to-text, natural language processing, and text-to-speech

## Agent Assist
Agent Assist, the second pillar of CCAI, which helps human agents become specialists by providing them real-time information and feedback.

### The purpose of Agent Assist
- Supports human agents in real time
- Provides the context necessary for a seamless transition, then stays active in the conversation behind-the-scenes.
- Focuses on complex issues
### The features of Agent Assist
- Provides account information and articles
- Improves the model via feedback
- Real-time assistance
